* I have done a bit research and learned about <strike> tag for the line being crossed. 
* To create the sentence italic, bold and creating links are easy.
* Difficult part so far is to keep the different paragraph in same space without using <br> tag. I still need to find information for this. 
* Tried to read again and again to understand what the author wants me to write, and tried to code again. Find the things that I don't know in google.
